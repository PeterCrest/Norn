End User License Agreement

This End User License Agreement ("Agreement") is a legal contract between you as an individual or business organisation ("you" or "Licensee") and the Norn developer ("Licensor") for the Norn software (all editions), including any associated media, printed materials and electronic documentation (the "Software").

By copying, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using the Software, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement and you warrant and represent that you are authorised to enter into this Agreement on behalf of yourself or your business organisation.

If you do not wish to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, you may not download, install, access or use the Software.

• DEFINITIONS

"Authorized User" means any employee, independent contractor or other temporary worker authorized by Licensee to use the Software while performing duties within the scope of their employment or assignment.

"License Key" means a unique key-code that enables a single Authorized User to use the Software at a time. Only Licensor and/or its representatives are permitted to produce License Keys for the Software.

"Commercial Use" means any use of the Software in connection with a business, including but not limited to: (a) use by an employee or contractor during paid work hours, (b) use to develop, test, or maintain software or services that generate revenue, (c) use within a for-profit organisation, or (d) use in CI/CD pipelines for commercial projects.

"Personal Use" means use by an individual for personal projects, learning, education, or open-source projects that do not generate revenue.

• OWNERSHIP

This Agreement does not convey to you any rights of ownership in the Software. All right, title, benefit and interest in the Software and in any ideas, know-how, and programs which are developed by Licensor in the course of providing any technical services, including any enhancements or modifications made to the Software, shall at all times remain the property of Licensor.

• GRANT OF LICENSE

Upon your acceptance of this Agreement, Licensor grants you a limited, non-transferable, non-assignable, non-exclusive license to install and use the Software on the terms and conditions set forth herein.

• INTENDED USERS OF THE SOFTWARE

The Norn software is licensed to provide functionality to test APIs in Visual Studio Code as an Extension. The Norn CLI can be used locally on the user's computer for Personal Use without a license. A license is required to use the Software for Commercial Use, including use of the Norn CLI in CI/CD build pipelines.

• FREE USE (PERSONAL USE)

You may install and use the Software free of charge for Personal Use, including:

Businesses and organisations may evaluate the Software for Commercial Use without a license for a period of fourteen (14) days from first use ("Evaluation Period"). The Evaluation Period is:
- Limited to one (1) evaluation period per organisation
- Intended for genuine evaluation purposes only
- Not to be used for production workloads or client projects
- Not extendable or renewable without written permission from the Licensor

After the Evaluation Period, continued Commercial Use requires a valid license. Abuse of the Evaluation Period, including but not limited to repeated evaluations by the same organisation, rotating users to extend evaluation, or using evaluation for production purposes, constitutes a breach of this Agreement.

A license is required for Commercial Use of the Software after the Evaluation Period. Commercial Use includes but is not limited to:

IN ANY CASE, LICENSOR'S ENTIRE LIABILITY UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY LICENSEE FOR SOFTWARE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.
